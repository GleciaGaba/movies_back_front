# Movie Review Application

## Overview

This project is part of a full stack development course where you will learn how to create a full stack application using modern technologies such as **MongoDB** for the database, **Java** and **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **React** for the frontend.

In this project, you will develop a **Movie Review Application** that follows the principles of separation of concerns, allowing the client-side and server-side components to evolve independently while maintaining functionality. This loosely coupled architecture enables flexibility in maintaining and scaling the application.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React, the user interface allows users to browse movies, read and post reviews, and view ratings.
- **Backend**: Developed with Java and Spring Boot, the server-side handles user authentication, manages movie data, and processes review submissions.
- **Database**: MongoDB stores movie data, user information, and reviews in a scalable NoSQL structure.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The frontend (client) and backend (server) are developed independently, using different technologies, and communicate via APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Axios (for API calls)

- **Backend**: 
  - Java
  - Spring Boot (RESTful API)
  - MongoDB (for data persistence)
  
- **Other Tools**:
  - Git & GitHub for version control
  - Postman for API testing
  - Docker (optional, for containerizing the application)
