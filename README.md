# Movie Review Application

## Overview

Welcome to my Movie Review Application project! This is part of a full stack development course where I am learning to create modern web applications using **MongoDB** for the database, **Java** and **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **React** for the frontend.

This application demonstrates the concept of separation of concerns between client-side and server-side code. By designing the app with a loosely coupled architecture, the frontend and backend are able to evolve independently, which makes the development process smoother and more efficient. 

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React, the user interface provides an intuitive way to browse movies, post reviews, and view ratings.
- **Backend**: Powered by Java and Spring Boot, the backend handles movie data management, review processing, and user authentication.
- **Database**: MongoDB stores all the movie data, reviews, and user information, leveraging a scalable NoSQL model.
- **API Communication**: The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs, making the application modular and flexible.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Axios (for API requests)

- **Backend**:
  - Java
  - Spring Boot (RESTful API)
  - MongoDB for data persistence

- **Other Tools**:
  - Git for version control
  - Postman for API testing
  - Docker (optional, for containerization)
